Conducted a full-cycle data science project to predict obesity levels using demographic, lifestyle, and dietary data from 2,111 individuals. Performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and hypothesis testing to uncover relationships between physical activity, eating habits, age, and BMI. Built and compared classification models including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, achieving high predictive accuracy. Also evaluated model performance with and without BMI-related features to ensure real-world applicability and reduce dependency on circular logic. The project offers insights into risk factors for obesity and demonstrates the potential for early health risk identification through behavioral data.
